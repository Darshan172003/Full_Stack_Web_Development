/* % Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue",all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else) ! */
/* @ CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: 
    # Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 
    $ Internal - by using a <style>element in the <head>section 
    & External - by using a <link>element to link to an external CSS file */
